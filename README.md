# API Interview Questions

### What is an API?

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). It is a type of software interface that exposes a set of services or actions that developers can use to build or integrate their applications [Source 3](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/what-is-api-definition-types-specifications-documentation/). APIs are not intended to be used directly by end-users, but rather by developers who incorporate them into their software [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).

APIs are designed to simplify programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions that developers need [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). They enable data transmission between different software products and contain the terms of this data exchange [Source 3](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/what-is-api-definition-types-specifications-documentation/). APIs can be implemented for various purposes, such as programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).

Modern APIs typically adhere to specific standards, such as HTTP and REST, which make them developer-friendly, self-described, easily accessible, and understood broadly [Source 1](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api). They are treated more like products than code, designed for consumption by specific audiences, and documented and versioned in a way that allows users to have clear expectations of their maintenance and lifecycle [Source 1](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api).

APIs can be monitored and managed for both performance and scale, and they have a stronger discipline for security and governance [Source 1](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api). They enable improved collaboration by allowing integration between various platforms and applications, breaking down information silos and promoting seamless communication [Source 4](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api).

There are different types of APIs, such as web APIs or Web Service APIs, which enable communication between a web server and a web browser [Source 2](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/). REST API is a special type of Web API that uses a standard architectural style [Source 2](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/).

In summary, APIs play a crucial role in software development by facilitating communication between different applications, simplifying programming, and enabling integration and collaboration. They are essential components in the modern software landscape, and understanding their purpose and functionality is vital for developers and organizations alike. 

### What is an endpoint?

An API endpoint is a digital location where an API receives requests about a specific resource on its server [Source 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-endpoint). In APIs, an endpoint is typically a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that provides the location of a resource on the server [Source 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-endpoint). Endpoints are the main points of interaction between the API and the server, and they play a crucial role in the API's documentation [Source 3](https://apipheny.io/api-endpoint/).

It's important to note that endpoints and APIs are different. An endpoint is a component of an API, while an API is a set of rules that allow two applications to share resources [Source 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-endpoint). Endpoints are the locations of the resources, and the API uses endpoint URLs to retrieve the requested resources [Source 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-endpoint).

In the context of API design and development, endpoints are used to define the various resources and actions that can be performed through an API [Source 8](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/api-endpoints). They can be bound to different protocols and HTTP methods, which determine the way the API communicates with the server and the client [Source 8](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/api-endpoints).

To create your own API endpoint, you can follow these steps [Source 2](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/endpoint/):

1. Go to the Endpoints tab of your API Definition.
2. Select the "+Create Endpoint" button.
3. Define the name, description, method, path, group, and other settings for the endpoint.
4. Optionally, specify custom headers, query string parameters, and other settings for the endpoint.

It's crucial to secure API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches [Source 7](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/api-endpoint/). Some basic security measures include using HTTPS for all API endpoints, implementing access controls, and using authentication and authorization mechanisms [Source 7](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/api-endpoint/). 

### What is a request in API testing?

A request in API testing refers to a specific API call made to a particular endpoint, which can be either a GET, POST, or other HTTP methods. It is a single type of request that is directed to a specific endpoint, allowing you to move between different endpoints while testing the API's functionality, reliability, performance, and security [Source 8](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-test-and-play-with-web-apis-the-easy-way-with-postman/).

API testing is a set of quality assurance actions that include making calls to an API endpoint, getting API responses, and validating API status codes, response times, and data against predefined rules [Source 0](https://reqbin.com/). It is performed at the message layer without a GUI and is now considered critical for automating testing due to the short release cycles and frequent changes in Agile software development and DevOps [Source 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing).

There are several types of tests that can be performed on APIs, such as smoke testing, functional testing, security testing, penetration testing, and validation testing. These tests help ensure that the API meets expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security [Source 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing).

When testing API requests, it is important to understand the API requirements, specify the API output status, and create both positive and negative tests. Positive tests verify that the API receives input and returns the expected output as specified in the requirement, while negative tests verify that the API returns an appropriate response when the expected output does not exist [Source 6](https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/api-testing-tips).

API testing also involves authorization, which is how requests are authenticated with an API, whether by a person making a request or by a computer making that request on your behalf. This commonly comes in the form of an API key, which can be a static value assigned to your account or dynamically generated with tools like OAuth [Source 8](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-test-and-play-with-web-apis-the-easy-way-with-postman/). 

### Can you explain the API lifecycle?

The API lifecycle is a crucial aspect of managing and maintaining APIs throughout their entire life span. It includes various stages, such as planning, designing, securing, analyzing, and retiring APIs. The lifecycle is essential for ensuring the smooth functioning, security, and adaptability of APIs in an ever-evolving environment [Source 7](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-full-lifecycle-api-management).

There are different approaches to understanding the API lifecycle. Nordic APIs identifies four main phases [Source 3](https://nordicapis.com/envisioning-the-entire-api-lifecycle/), while MuleSoft describes three distinct stages: design, implementation, and management [Source 7](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-full-lifecycle-api-management). Another approach divides the API lifecycle into seven stages [Source 8](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-lifecycle-management/). However, these approaches may overlap and depend on the decisions made in previous stages.

The key stages of the API lifecycle include:

1. **Planning**: This stage involves identifying the need for an API, defining its purpose, and determining its target audience [Source 6](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/API-lifecycle-management).

2. **Design**: In this stage, API designers create a detailed blueprint of the API, including its endpoints, data models, authentication mechanisms, and error handling [Source 1](https://dzone.com/articles/the-api-life-cycle).

3. **Development**: During the development stage, developers implement the API design, ensuring that it adheres to the specified requirements and follows best practices [Source 6](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/API-lifecycle-management).

4. **Testing**: This stage involves thorough testing of the API to ensure that it functions as expected and meets the defined requirements [Source 6](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/API-lifecycle-management).

5. **Deployment**: Once the API has been tested and approved, it is deployed to a production environment, making it available for consumers [Source 6](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/API-lifecycle-management).

6. **Analysis**: In this stage, the API is monitored and analyzed to identify any issues, bottlenecks, or areas for improvement [Source 7](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-full-lifecycle-api-management).

7. **Retirement**: When an API is no longer needed or has become obsolete, it is retired, and its resources are freed up for other purposes [Source 8](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-lifecycle-management/).

API lifecycle management offers several benefits, such as providing a framework for planning and controlling the API's future, estimating the progress of an API project, and keeping different stakeholders involved and informed [Source 8](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-lifecycle-management/).

To ensure effective API lifecycle management, it is essential to adopt a unified API management solution that covers the entire lifecycle, from design to retirement [Source 7](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-full-lifecycle-api-management). This approach allows for better coordination between API design, development, testing, and management, leading to a more streamlined and efficient API development process. 

### How is a payload used in API testing?

In API testing, a payload is the actual data or information pack that is sent with the GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH methods in HTTP. It is the crucial information that you submit to the server when you are making an API request. The payload can be sent or received in various formats, including JSON, XML, or plain text [Source 2](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/payload/).

In API testing, payloads are used to test the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of APIs. The payload is the part of a query string that carries the essential message or information required by the server to generate a response or the user to make a decision [Source 2](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/payload/).

To submit a request to a REST Web API, you can use different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH, depending on your testing goals. To specify the request body, navigate to the Post Data section and paste or enter the JSON content into the field. The system will automatically parse the code and prompt you to select a content type header based on the request body type [Source 4](https://www.dotcom-monitor.com/wiki/knowledge-base/pushing-payload-to-rest-web-api/).

When testing with large request payloads, tools like Parasoft SOAtest's Smart API Test Generator can help generate test automation scripts, making it easier to test large JSON request payloads [Source 0](https://www.parasoft.com/blog/how-to-automate-rest-api-testing-with-large-request-payloads/).

In summary, a payload is a critical component in API testing as it carries the necessary information for the server to process and generate responses. It is essential to ensure that the payload is formatted correctly and submitted with the appropriate HTTP method to effectively test the API's functionality, reliability, performance, and security.

Each of these tools has its own set of features, pros, and cons. The choice of the tool depends on factors such as the complexity of the API, the team's skill set, and the organization's requirements. It is essential to evaluate each tool based on your specific needs and preferences before making a decision. 

### What is CURL? Can you provide an example?

Curl is a popular command-line utility and open-source library (libcurl) that enables users to send HTTP requests from clients to servers. It supports over 25 protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Curl has built-in support for SSL certificates, HTTP cookies, user authentication, proxies, and certificate validation [Source 0](https://reqbin.com/req/c-s3bfyrby/curl-examples).

A simple example of using Curl is to send an HTTP GET request without specifying any parameters. In this case, Curl sends an HTTP GET request and prints the HTTP response of the corresponding URL:

  ```
  curl https://reqbin.com/echo
  ```

This command retrieves the content of the specified URL and displays it in the terminal [Source 0](https://reqbin.com/req/c-s3bfyrby/curl-examples).

Curl also allows you to specify additional headers, customize the request, and manage cookies. For example, you can pass a custom header, such as "X-you-and-me: yes", to the server when getting a page:

  ```
  curl -H "X-you-and-me: yes" www.love.com
  ```

This command sends the "X-you-and-me: yes" header to the server along with the request [Source 2](https://curl.se/docs/manual.html).

Curl provides many other options and features for customizing requests, such as changing the user agent, referrer, and handling different protocols. You can find a comprehensive list of options in the [Curl manual](https://curl.se/docs/manual.html) and [Curl command usage with real-time examples](https://geekflare.com/curl-command-usage-with-example/) [Source 5](https://geekflare.com/curl-command-usage-with-example/), [Source 3](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/curl-command). 

### What are some of the HTTP methods used in API testing?

Some of the HTTP methods used in API testing include:

1. **GET**: The most common and widely used method, GET is used to retrieve data from a server at a specified resource. It is considered safe and idempotent as it only requests data without modifying any resources [Source 0](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).

2. **POST**: Used to send data to the API server and create or update a resource. API tests for POST methods should ensure that a 200 status code is returned, and the data is saved correctly [Source 0](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).

3. **PUT**: Similar to POST, PUT is used to update a resource. Tests for PUT methods should verify that the content is updated correctly, and the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code [Source 1](https://testfully.io/blog/http-methods/).

4. **PATCH**: PATCH is used to partially update a resource. To test an API with the PATCH method, follow the steps discussed for PUT and POST methods, and ensure that the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code [Source 1](https://testfully.io/blog/http-methods/).

5. **DELETE**: Used to delete a resource. Tests for DELETE methods should ensure that the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code, and the resource is deleted [Source 2](https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/).

6. **OPTIONS**: OPTIONS requests return data describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL. Tests for OPTIONS methods should ensure that the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code and the correct supported methods are listed [Source 0](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).

7. **HEAD**: HEAD requests are used to simply verify that a resource is available. They should be tested alongside GET requests, as long as the API supports it. Tests for HEAD requests should ensure that the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code and the same information as the original request [Source 0](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).

8. **TRACE**: TRACE requests are used to retrieve a diagnostic representation of the request and response messages for a specific request. To test an API with the TRACE method, make a standard HTTP request like a GET request and check the server's response. If the response has the same information as the original request, the TRACE ability is enabled in the server and works correctly [Source 1](https://testfully.io/blog/http-methods/).

These methods are crucial for API testing as they allow you to verify the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the API endpoints. Testing each method ensures that the API behaves as expected and returns the correct responses [Source 4](https://medium.com/@hsnhksrn/api-testing-post-get-put-delete-791629926799). 

### How do you handle authentication in API testing?

Handling authentication in API testing involves understanding the different authentication methods used in APIs and implementing them in your testing strategy. The most common authentication methods include HTTP Basic Authentication, API Key Authentication, Bearer Authentication, and OAuth Authentication 2.0 [Source 0](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/most-popular-api-authentication-methods/), [Source 3](https://testfully.io/blog/api-authentication/).

**HTTP Basic Authentication**

In this method, the username and password are sent alongside every API call using an HTTP header. It is important to use HTTPS to encrypt the connection between the parties [Source 0](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/most-popular-api-authentication-methods/).

**API Key Authentication**

API Key Authentication creates unique keys for developers and passes them alongside every request. The API generates a secret key that is a long, difficult-to-guess string of numbers and letters. It is typically passed alongside the API authorization header [Source 0](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/most-popular-api-authentication-methods/).

**Bearer Authentication**

Bearer Authentication, also known as token authentication, is a two-step process. First, you acquire a token from an authentication server. Then, you use the token to authenticate and authorize your requests. The token is passed as an HTTP header called `Authorization` in the form of `Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}` [Source 3](https://testfully.io/blog/api-authentication/).

**OAuth Authentication 2.0**

OAuth Authentication 2.0 offers security scalability and the best user experience. It provides a federated system module that allows users to leverage an existing authentication mechanism. However, it requires more work for developers and API providers to implement and maintain [Source 0](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/most-popular-api-authentication-methods/).

To handle authentication in API testing, you can follow these steps:

1. Choose the appropriate authentication method for your API based on your security requirements and ease of implementation.

2. Implement the chosen authentication method in your API testing strategy. This may include sending the required credentials or tokens along with your API requests.

3. Ensure that your API requests are made over HTTPS, especially when using methods like HTTP Basic Authentication and Bearer Authentication, to encrypt the connection between the parties.

4. Follow best practices for API security, such as access control, encryption, vulnerability assessment, quotas and throttling for APIs, and using an API gateway [Source 4](https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/article/api-security-testing.html).

5. Use tools like LoadView for load testing web APIs that require authentication to ensure a better experience [Source 7](https://www.loadview-testing.com/blog/load-testing-web-apis-that-require-authentication/).

6. If you need help with API security testing, consider using services like Beagle Security, which offers automated security testing and reporting based on OWASP & SANS security standards [Source 4](https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/article/api-security-testing.html). 

### Can you tell me about some of the common HTTP status codes used in API testing?

Here are some common HTTP status codes used in API testing:

1. **200 OK** ([Source 7](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)): The request has succeeded, and the server has returned the requested data. The response typically contains an entity that represents the requested resource.

2. **201 Created** ([Source 7](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)): The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created as a result. The response should include a Location header field containing the URI of the newly created resource.

3. **202 Accepted** ([Source 7](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)): The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The server should return a 200 OK status code when the processing is complete.

4. **400 Bad Request** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The server cannot process the request due to malformed syntax or invalid data. The client should not repeat the request without modifications.

5. **401 Unauthorized** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The request requires authentication, and the provided credentials are either missing or incorrect. The client should provide valid credentials to proceed.

6. **403 Forbidden** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The client does not have permission to access the requested resource. The server may return this status code even if the request syntax is correct.

7. **404 Not Found** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The requested resource could not be found on the server. The server should not return this status code if the resource is temporarily unavailable or if the client has made a mistake in the request.

8. **405 Method Not Allowed** ([Source 2](https://metamug.com/article/status-codes-for-rest-api.html)): The request method used by the client is not supported for the requested resource.

9. **406 Not Acceptable** ([Source 2](https://metamug.com/article/status-codes-for-rest-api.html)): The server cannot provide a response that matches the list of acceptable values defined by the client.

10. **500 Internal Server Error** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The server encountered an error while processing the request. This status code is a generic error response, and the client should be able to retry the request.

11. **502 Bad Gateway** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.

12. **503 Service Unavailable** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or maintenance of the server.

These are just a few examples of common HTTP status codes used in API testing. Understanding these status codes can help you identify issues more quickly and ensure that your API responses are appropriate for different situations. 

### What is a RESTful API and how does it differ from other APIs?

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an application programming interface that adheres to the constraints of the REST architectural style. It allows for interaction with RESTful web services and typically takes advantage of the HTTP protocol. RESTful APIs are designed to be scalable, maintainable, and flexible, supporting different data formats and handling various types of calls ([Source 1](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api), [Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

RESTful APIs differ from other APIs in several ways:

1. **Protocol**: While RESTful APIs typically use HTTP, other APIs like SOAP may use different protocols, such as XML.

2. **Data Formats**: RESTful APIs can return various data formats, such as XML, JSON, or YAML, based on the client's request, whereas other APIs may be limited to specific formats ([Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

3. **Statelessness**: RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that each request contains all the necessary information to complete itself successfully. This allows for better scalability and reduces the load on the server. Other APIs may not adhere to this constraint.

4. **Uniform Interface**: RESTful APIs provide a uniform interface that allows independent evolution of the application without tightly coupling the application's services, models, and actions to the API layer itself ([Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

5. **Caching**: RESTful APIs support caching, which can improve performance by reducing the number of requests sent to the server. Other APIs may not support this feature.

6. **Layered System**: RESTful APIs have different layers of their architecture working together to build a more scalable and modular application ([Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

7. **Code on Demand**: RESTful APIs can transmit code or applets via the API for use within the application, while other APIs may not support this feature ([Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

In summary, a RESTful API is an implementation of the REST architecture that provides a standardized, scalable, and flexible way to build and maintain web services. It differs from other APIs in terms of protocol, data formats, statelessness, uniform interface, caching, layered system, and code on demand. 

### What does a cross-origin request mean?

A cross-origin request is a type of HTTP request made by a web application running on one domain to access resources or data from another domain. This is restricted by the same-origin policy, which limits web applications from interacting with resources outside of the source domain to prevent security risks. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows relaxation of the same-origin policy, enabling secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers [Source 0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

CORS uses a set of HTTP headers to establish trusted web origins and associated properties, such as whether authenticated access is permitted. This header exchange between the browser and the cross-origin website helps in determining if the cross-origin request should be allowed or not [Source 2](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors).

When a cross-origin request is made, the browser sends an extra "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource. The server responds with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, indicating whether the request from the origin is allowed or not. This preflight request helps the browser to check the server's response before making the actual request [Source 0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

There are different ways to configure cross-origin requests:

- Allow specific origins: Specify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with the allowed origin(s) to grant access to specific resources [Source 2](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors).
- Allow all origins: Set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a wildcard `*` to allow requests from any domain. However, this approach should be used cautiously, as it may expose sensitive information to untrusted websites [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

It is important to note that only trusted sites should be specified in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Dynamically reflecting origins without validation is exploitable and should be avoided [Source 2](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors).

In summary, a cross-origin request is an HTTP request made by a web application on one domain to access resources from another domain. CORS is a mechanism that allows relaxation of the same-origin policy, enabling secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers. Proper configuration of cross-origin requests is crucial to ensure the security and integrity of web applications.

# API Testing | Postman -  Interview Questions

## API TESTING

### What is an API?

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). It is a type of software interface that exposes a set of services or actions that developers can use to build or integrate their applications [Source 3](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/what-is-api-definition-types-specifications-documentation/). APIs are not intended to be used directly by end-users, but rather by developers who incorporate them into their software [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).

APIs are designed to simplify programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions that developers need [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). They enable data transmission between different software products and contain the terms of this data exchange [Source 3](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/what-is-api-definition-types-specifications-documentation/). APIs can be implemented for various purposes, such as programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).

Modern APIs typically adhere to specific standards, such as HTTP and REST, which make them developer-friendly, self-described, easily accessible, and understood broadly [Source 1](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api). They are treated more like products than code, designed for consumption by specific audiences, and documented and versioned in a way that allows users to have clear expectations of their maintenance and lifecycle [Source 1](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api).

APIs can be monitored and managed for both performance and scale, and they have a stronger discipline for security and governance [Source 1](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api). They enable improved collaboration by allowing integration between various platforms and applications, breaking down information silos and promoting seamless communication [Source 4](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api).

There are different types of APIs, such as web APIs or Web Service APIs, which enable communication between a web server and a web browser [Source 2](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/). REST API is a special type of Web API that uses a standard architectural style [Source 2](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/).

In summary, APIs play a crucial role in software development by facilitating communication between different applications, simplifying programming, and enabling integration and collaboration. They are essential components in the modern software landscape, and understanding their purpose and functionality is vital for developers and organizations alike. 

### What is an endpoint?

An API endpoint is a digital location where an API receives requests about a specific resource on its server [Source 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-endpoint). In APIs, an endpoint is typically a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that provides the location of a resource on the server [Source 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-endpoint). Endpoints are the main points of interaction between the API and the server, and they play a crucial role in the API's documentation [Source 3](https://apipheny.io/api-endpoint/).

It's important to note that endpoints and APIs are different. An endpoint is a component of an API, while an API is a set of rules that allow two applications to share resources [Source 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-endpoint). Endpoints are the locations of the resources, and the API uses endpoint URLs to retrieve the requested resources [Source 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-endpoint).

In the context of API design and development, endpoints are used to define the various resources and actions that can be performed through an API [Source 8](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/api-endpoints). They can be bound to different protocols and HTTP methods, which determine the way the API communicates with the server and the client [Source 8](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/api-endpoints).

To create your own API endpoint, you can follow these steps [Source 2](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/endpoint/):

1. Go to the Endpoints tab of your API Definition.
2. Select the "+Create Endpoint" button.
3. Define the name, description, method, path, group, and other settings for the endpoint.
4. Optionally, specify custom headers, query string parameters, and other settings for the endpoint.

It's crucial to secure API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches [Source 7](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/api-endpoint/). Some basic security measures include using HTTPS for all API endpoints, implementing access controls, and using authentication and authorization mechanisms [Source 7](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/api-endpoint/). 

### What is a request in API testing?

A request in API testing refers to a specific API call made to a particular endpoint, which can be either a GET, POST, or other HTTP methods. It is a single type of request that is directed to a specific endpoint, allowing you to move between different endpoints while testing the API's functionality, reliability, performance, and security [Source 8](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-test-and-play-with-web-apis-the-easy-way-with-postman/).

API testing is a set of quality assurance actions that include making calls to an API endpoint, getting API responses, and validating API status codes, response times, and data against predefined rules [Source 0](https://reqbin.com/). It is performed at the message layer without a GUI and is now considered critical for automating testing due to the short release cycles and frequent changes in Agile software development and DevOps [Source 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing).

There are several types of tests that can be performed on APIs, such as smoke testing, functional testing, security testing, penetration testing, and validation testing. These tests help ensure that the API meets expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security [Source 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing).

When testing API requests, it is important to understand the API requirements, specify the API output status, and create both positive and negative tests. Positive tests verify that the API receives input and returns the expected output as specified in the requirement, while negative tests verify that the API returns an appropriate response when the expected output does not exist [Source 6](https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/api-testing-tips).

API testing also involves authorization, which is how requests are authenticated with an API, whether by a person making a request or by a computer making that request on your behalf. This commonly comes in the form of an API key, which can be a static value assigned to your account or dynamically generated with tools like OAuth [Source 8](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-test-and-play-with-web-apis-the-easy-way-with-postman/). 

### Can you explain the API lifecycle?

The API lifecycle is a crucial aspect of managing and maintaining APIs throughout their entire life span. It includes various stages, such as planning, designing, securing, analyzing, and retiring APIs. The lifecycle is essential for ensuring the smooth functioning, security, and adaptability of APIs in an ever-evolving environment [Source 7](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-full-lifecycle-api-management).

There are different approaches to understanding the API lifecycle. Nordic APIs identifies four main phases [Source 3](https://nordicapis.com/envisioning-the-entire-api-lifecycle/), while MuleSoft describes three distinct stages: design, implementation, and management [Source 7](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-full-lifecycle-api-management). Another approach divides the API lifecycle into seven stages [Source 8](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-lifecycle-management/). However, these approaches may overlap and depend on the decisions made in previous stages.

The key stages of the API lifecycle include:

1. **Planning**: This stage involves identifying the need for an API, defining its purpose, and determining its target audience [Source 6](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/API-lifecycle-management).

2. **Design**: In this stage, API designers create a detailed blueprint of the API, including its endpoints, data models, authentication mechanisms, and error handling [Source 1](https://dzone.com/articles/the-api-life-cycle).

3. **Development**: During the development stage, developers implement the API design, ensuring that it adheres to the specified requirements and follows best practices [Source 6](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/API-lifecycle-management).

4. **Testing**: This stage involves thorough testing of the API to ensure that it functions as expected and meets the defined requirements [Source 6](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/API-lifecycle-management).

5. **Deployment**: Once the API has been tested and approved, it is deployed to a production environment, making it available for consumers [Source 6](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/API-lifecycle-management).

6. **Analysis**: In this stage, the API is monitored and analyzed to identify any issues, bottlenecks, or areas for improvement [Source 7](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-full-lifecycle-api-management).

7. **Retirement**: When an API is no longer needed or has become obsolete, it is retired, and its resources are freed up for other purposes [Source 8](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-lifecycle-management/).

API lifecycle management offers several benefits, such as providing a framework for planning and controlling the API's future, estimating the progress of an API project, and keeping different stakeholders involved and informed [Source 8](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-lifecycle-management/).

To ensure effective API lifecycle management, it is essential to adopt a unified API management solution that covers the entire lifecycle, from design to retirement [Source 7](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-full-lifecycle-api-management). This approach allows for better coordination between API design, development, testing, and management, leading to a more streamlined and efficient API development process. 

### How is a payload used in API testing?

In API testing, a payload is the actual data or information pack that is sent with the GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH methods in HTTP. It is the crucial information that you submit to the server when you are making an API request. The payload can be sent or received in various formats, including JSON, XML, or plain text [Source 2](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/payload/).

In API testing, payloads are used to test the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of APIs. The payload is the part of a query string that carries the essential message or information required by the server to generate a response or the user to make a decision [Source 2](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/payload/).

To submit a request to a REST Web API, you can use different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH, depending on your testing goals. To specify the request body, navigate to the Post Data section and paste or enter the JSON content into the field. The system will automatically parse the code and prompt you to select a content type header based on the request body type [Source 4](https://www.dotcom-monitor.com/wiki/knowledge-base/pushing-payload-to-rest-web-api/).

When testing with large request payloads, tools like Parasoft SOAtest's Smart API Test Generator can help generate test automation scripts, making it easier to test large JSON request payloads [Source 0](https://www.parasoft.com/blog/how-to-automate-rest-api-testing-with-large-request-payloads/).

In summary, a payload is a critical component in API testing as it carries the necessary information for the server to process and generate responses. It is essential to ensure that the payload is formatted correctly and submitted with the appropriate HTTP method to effectively test the API's functionality, reliability, performance, and security.

Each of these tools has its own set of features, pros, and cons. The choice of the tool depends on factors such as the complexity of the API, the team's skill set, and the organization's requirements. It is essential to evaluate each tool based on your specific needs and preferences before making a decision. 

### What is CURL? Can you provide an example?

Curl is a popular command-line utility and open-source library (libcurl) that enables users to send HTTP requests from clients to servers. It supports over 25 protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Curl has built-in support for SSL certificates, HTTP cookies, user authentication, proxies, and certificate validation [Source 0](https://reqbin.com/req/c-s3bfyrby/curl-examples).

A simple example of using Curl is to send an HTTP GET request without specifying any parameters. In this case, Curl sends an HTTP GET request and prints the HTTP response of the corresponding URL:

  ```
  curl https://reqbin.com/echo
  ```

This command retrieves the content of the specified URL and displays it in the terminal [Source 0](https://reqbin.com/req/c-s3bfyrby/curl-examples).

Curl also allows you to specify additional headers, customize the request, and manage cookies. For example, you can pass a custom header, such as "X-you-and-me: yes", to the server when getting a page:

  ```
  curl -H "X-you-and-me: yes" www.love.com
  ```

This command sends the "X-you-and-me: yes" header to the server along with the request [Source 2](https://curl.se/docs/manual.html).

Curl provides many other options and features for customizing requests, such as changing the user agent, referrer, and handling different protocols. You can find a comprehensive list of options in the [Curl manual](https://curl.se/docs/manual.html) and [Curl command usage with real-time examples](https://geekflare.com/curl-command-usage-with-example/) [Source 5](https://geekflare.com/curl-command-usage-with-example/), [Source 3](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/curl-command). 

### What are some of the HTTP methods used in API testing?

Some of the HTTP methods used in API testing include:

1. **GET**: The most common and widely used method, GET is used to retrieve data from a server at a specified resource. It is considered safe and idempotent as it only requests data without modifying any resources [Source 0](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).

2. **POST**: Used to send data to the API server and create or update a resource. API tests for POST methods should ensure that a 200 status code is returned, and the data is saved correctly [Source 0](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).

3. **PUT**: Similar to POST, PUT is used to update a resource. Tests for PUT methods should verify that the content is updated correctly, and the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code [Source 1](https://testfully.io/blog/http-methods/).

4. **PATCH**: PATCH is used to partially update a resource. To test an API with the PATCH method, follow the steps discussed for PUT and POST methods, and ensure that the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code [Source 1](https://testfully.io/blog/http-methods/).

5. **DELETE**: Used to delete a resource. Tests for DELETE methods should ensure that the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code, and the resource is deleted [Source 2](https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/).

6. **OPTIONS**: OPTIONS requests return data describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL. Tests for OPTIONS methods should ensure that the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code and the correct supported methods are listed [Source 0](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).

7. **HEAD**: HEAD requests are used to simply verify that a resource is available. They should be tested alongside GET requests, as long as the API supports it. Tests for HEAD requests should ensure that the server returns a 2xx HTTP status code and the same information as the original request [Source 0](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them).

8. **TRACE**: TRACE requests are used to retrieve a diagnostic representation of the request and response messages for a specific request. To test an API with the TRACE method, make a standard HTTP request like a GET request and check the server's response. If the response has the same information as the original request, the TRACE ability is enabled in the server and works correctly [Source 1](https://testfully.io/blog/http-methods/).

These methods are crucial for API testing as they allow you to verify the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the API endpoints. Testing each method ensures that the API behaves as expected and returns the correct responses [Source 4](https://medium.com/@hsnhksrn/api-testing-post-get-put-delete-791629926799). 

### How do you handle authentication in API testing?

Handling authentication in API testing involves understanding the different authentication methods used in APIs and implementing them in your testing strategy. The most common authentication methods include HTTP Basic Authentication, API Key Authentication, Bearer Authentication, and OAuth Authentication 2.0 [Source 0](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/most-popular-api-authentication-methods/), [Source 3](https://testfully.io/blog/api-authentication/).

**HTTP Basic Authentication**

In this method, the username and password are sent alongside every API call using an HTTP header. It is important to use HTTPS to encrypt the connection between the parties [Source 0](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/most-popular-api-authentication-methods/).

**API Key Authentication**

API Key Authentication creates unique keys for developers and passes them alongside every request. The API generates a secret key that is a long, difficult-to-guess string of numbers and letters. It is typically passed alongside the API authorization header [Source 0](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/most-popular-api-authentication-methods/).

**Bearer Authentication**

Bearer Authentication, also known as token authentication, is a two-step process. First, you acquire a token from an authentication server. Then, you use the token to authenticate and authorize your requests. The token is passed as an HTTP header called `Authorization` in the form of `Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}` [Source 3](https://testfully.io/blog/api-authentication/).

**OAuth Authentication 2.0**

OAuth Authentication 2.0 offers security scalability and the best user experience. It provides a federated system module that allows users to leverage an existing authentication mechanism. However, it requires more work for developers and API providers to implement and maintain [Source 0](https://www.3pillarglobal.com/insights/most-popular-api-authentication-methods/).

To handle authentication in API testing, you can follow these steps:

1. Choose the appropriate authentication method for your API based on your security requirements and ease of implementation.

2. Implement the chosen authentication method in your API testing strategy. This may include sending the required credentials or tokens along with your API requests.

3. Ensure that your API requests are made over HTTPS, especially when using methods like HTTP Basic Authentication and Bearer Authentication, to encrypt the connection between the parties.

4. Follow best practices for API security, such as access control, encryption, vulnerability assessment, quotas and throttling for APIs, and using an API gateway [Source 4](https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/article/api-security-testing.html).

5. Use tools like LoadView for load testing web APIs that require authentication to ensure a better experience [Source 7](https://www.loadview-testing.com/blog/load-testing-web-apis-that-require-authentication/).

6. If you need help with API security testing, consider using services like Beagle Security, which offers automated security testing and reporting based on OWASP & SANS security standards [Source 4](https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/article/api-security-testing.html). 

### Can you tell me about some of the common HTTP status codes used in API testing?

Here are some common HTTP status codes used in API testing:

1. **200 OK** ([Source 7](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)): The request has succeeded, and the server has returned the requested data. The response typically contains an entity that represents the requested resource.

2. **201 Created** ([Source 7](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)): The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created as a result. The response should include a Location header field containing the URI of the newly created resource.

3. **202 Accepted** ([Source 7](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)): The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The server should return a 200 OK status code when the processing is complete.

4. **400 Bad Request** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The server cannot process the request due to malformed syntax or invalid data. The client should not repeat the request without modifications.

5. **401 Unauthorized** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The request requires authentication, and the provided credentials are either missing or incorrect. The client should provide valid credentials to proceed.

6. **403 Forbidden** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The client does not have permission to access the requested resource. The server may return this status code even if the request syntax is correct.

7. **404 Not Found** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The requested resource could not be found on the server. The server should not return this status code if the resource is temporarily unavailable or if the client has made a mistake in the request.

8. **405 Method Not Allowed** ([Source 2](https://metamug.com/article/status-codes-for-rest-api.html)): The request method used by the client is not supported for the requested resource.

9. **406 Not Acceptable** ([Source 2](https://metamug.com/article/status-codes-for-rest-api.html)): The server cannot provide a response that matches the list of acceptable values defined by the client.

10. **500 Internal Server Error** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The server encountered an error while processing the request. This status code is a generic error response, and the client should be able to retry the request.

11. **502 Bad Gateway** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.

12. **503 Service Unavailable** ([Source 3](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/)): The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or maintenance of the server.

These are just a few examples of common HTTP status codes used in API testing. Understanding these status codes can help you identify issues more quickly and ensure that your API responses are appropriate for different situations. 

### What is a RESTful API and how does it differ from other APIs?

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an application programming interface that adheres to the constraints of the REST architectural style. It allows for interaction with RESTful web services and typically takes advantage of the HTTP protocol. RESTful APIs are designed to be scalable, maintainable, and flexible, supporting different data formats and handling various types of calls ([Source 1](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api), [Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

RESTful APIs differ from other APIs in several ways:

1. **Protocol**: While RESTful APIs typically use HTTP, other APIs like SOAP may use different protocols, such as XML.

2. **Data Formats**: RESTful APIs can return various data formats, such as XML, JSON, or YAML, based on the client's request, whereas other APIs may be limited to specific formats ([Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

3. **Statelessness**: RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that each request contains all the necessary information to complete itself successfully. This allows for better scalability and reduces the load on the server. Other APIs may not adhere to this constraint.

4. **Uniform Interface**: RESTful APIs provide a uniform interface that allows independent evolution of the application without tightly coupling the application's services, models, and actions to the API layer itself ([Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

5. **Caching**: RESTful APIs support caching, which can improve performance by reducing the number of requests sent to the server. Other APIs may not support this feature.

6. **Layered System**: RESTful APIs have different layers of their architecture working together to build a more scalable and modular application ([Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

7. **Code on Demand**: RESTful APIs can transmit code or applets via the API for use within the application, while other APIs may not support this feature ([Source 5](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)).

In summary, a RESTful API is an implementation of the REST architecture that provides a standardized, scalable, and flexible way to build and maintain web services. It differs from other APIs in terms of protocol, data formats, statelessness, uniform interface, caching, layered system, and code on demand. 

### What does a cross-origin request mean?

A cross-origin request is a type of HTTP request made by a web application running on one domain to access resources or data from another domain. This is restricted by the same-origin policy, which limits web applications from interacting with resources outside of the source domain to prevent security risks. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows relaxation of the same-origin policy, enabling secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers [Source 0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

CORS uses a set of HTTP headers to establish trusted web origins and associated properties, such as whether authenticated access is permitted. This header exchange between the browser and the cross-origin website helps in determining if the cross-origin request should be allowed or not [Source 2](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors).

When a cross-origin request is made, the browser sends an extra "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource. The server responds with an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, indicating whether the request from the origin is allowed or not. This preflight request helps the browser to check the server's response before making the actual request [Source 0](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

There are different ways to configure cross-origin requests:

- Allow specific origins: Specify the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with the allowed origin(s) to grant access to specific resources [Source 2](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors).
- Allow all origins: Set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a wildcard `*` to allow requests from any domain. However, this approach should be used cautiously, as it may expose sensitive information to untrusted websites [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

It is important to note that only trusted sites should be specified in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Dynamically reflecting origins without validation is exploitable and should be avoided [Source 2](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors).

In summary, a cross-origin request is an HTTP request made by a web application on one domain to access resources from another domain. CORS is a mechanism that allows relaxation of the same-origin policy, enabling secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers. Proper configuration of cross-origin requests is crucial to ensure the security and integrity of web applications. 

## POSTMAN

### What experience do you have using Postman?

As a software tester, you can use Postman for API testing in various ways to streamline your workflows, validate API performance, reliability, and behavior, and collaborate with your team. Here's how you can practically use Postman for API testing:

1. **Create and store API requests**: Postman allows you to create, save, and manage simple and complex HTTP/s requests. You can store these requests and reuse them, reducing the need to remember exact endpoints, headers, and API keys [Source 7](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/how-use-postman-manage-and-execute-your-apis).

2. **Test any API with pre-configured code snippets**: Postman includes a JavaScript-based library of code snippets that enable you to easily author tests for various API architectures, including REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and gRPC [Source 6](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-testing/).

3. **Folders**: Organize your API requests into folders within collections. This helps when a service has APIs that can be neatly grouped by their response or request format [Source 4](https://medium.com/prospa-engineering/neatly-organise-your-postman-collections-to-navigate-your-micro-services-maze-b3c6616dd157). You can also use folders to attach scripts with related input or output formats [Source 4](https://medium.com/prospa-engineering/neatly-organise-your-postman-collections-to-navigate-your-micro-services-maze-b3c6616dd157).

4. **Pre-request scripts**: Use pre-request scripts to set up necessary data for API authorization or other tasks. You can configure different pre-request scripts for each collection [Source 4](https://medium.com/prospa-engineering/neatly-organise-your-postman-collections-to-navigate-your-micro-services-maze-b3c6616dd157).

5. **Post-request scripts**: Use post-request scripts to run after the requests have been executed. This can help format the data returned by APIs in a searchable and sortable manner [Source 4](https://medium.com/prospa-engineering/neatly-organise-your-postman-collections-to-navigate-your-micro-services-maze-b3c6616dd157).

6. **Share collections**: Share collections with team members using the 'Share Collection' option in Postman. This allows you to maintain a single source of truth for API development and makes it easier for team members to access and understand the API landscape [Source 6](https://toolsqa.com/postman/collections-in-postman/).

7. **Import collections**: Import collections from a folder by uploading them to Postman. This can be useful when you want to consolidate multiple collections into one workspace [Source 6](https://toolsqa.com/postman/collections-in-postman/).

By following these steps, you can create a well-organized Postman workspace that makes it easier to manage and navigate your API development process.

Postman offers various features and tools to help overcome these challenges and streamline the testing process. 

### Can you explain the differences between GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods?

In Postman, you can use different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE to interact with APIs. Each method has its own purpose and characteristics:

- **GET**: This method is used to request data from a specified resource. It is one of the most common HTTP methods and does not modify the resource on the server. [Source 3](https://scrolltest.medium.com/how-to-work-with-get-post-put-patch-delete-in-postman-in-10-min-a8cc24311426)

- **POST**: This method is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request. Unlike PUT, POST requests are not idempotent, meaning that calling a POST request multiple times may have side effects, such as creating the same resource multiple times. [Source 0](https://dev.to/promode/how-to-work-with-get-post-put-patch-delete-in-postman-in-10-min-41n6)

- **PUT**: This method is similar to POST, but it is used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. The main difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. Calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. [Source 0](https://dev.to/promode/how-to-work-with-get-post-put-patch-delete-in-postman-in-10-min-41n6)

- **PATCH**: This method is used to partially update an existing resource. The request body contains the specific changes to be applied to the resource, and the API service will create a new version according to those instructions. This is different from PUT, which replaces the entire resource with the new version. [Source 8](https://medium.com/@9cv9official/what-are-get-post-put-patch-delete-a-walkthrough-with-javascripts-fetch-api-17be31755d28)

- **DELETE**: This method is used to delete a resource specified by its URI. It sends a request to the server to delete the mentioned resource in the endpoint. [Source 5](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-create-a-delete-request-in-postman)

In summary, each HTTP method has its own purpose and characteristics:

- GET: Retrieve data from a specified resource
- POST: Create or update a resource with data in the request body
- PUT: Create or update a resource with data in the request body (idempotent)
- PATCH: Partially update an existing resource with specific changes
- DELETE: Delete a resource specified by its URI 

### Have you worked with authentication and authorization using Postman? If so, can you explain how you have implemented this in your testing?

To implement authorization and authentication in API testing using Postman, you can follow these steps:

1. **Select the appropriate authorization method**: Depending on the API, you might need to use different authorization methods like Basic Auth, API Keys, or OAuth 2.0. In Postman, go to the Authorization tab of the request and choose the appropriate method from the Type dropdown. [Source 6](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/understanding-api-authorization-options-in-postman/)

2. **Configure the authorization details**: For Basic Auth, provide a username and password. For API Keys, paste the API key into the Token field. For OAuth 2.0, fill in the required details, such as grant type, client ID, client secret, and callback URL. [Source 6](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/understanding-api-authorization-options-in-postman/), [Source 10](https://www.thirdrocktechkno.com/blog/how-to-write-authentication-test-cases-with-postman/)

3. **Request the access token**: For OAuth 2.0, click on the "Request Token" button to generate the access token. Postman will open a browser window for you to authorize the request. Once the token is generated, it will be shown in the Access token field. [Source 10](https://www.thirdrocktechkno.com/blog/how-to-write-authentication-test-cases-with-postman/)

4. **Use the access token**: After obtaining the access token, you can use it in your requests to access protected resources. To do this, go to the Headers tab in Postman and add the access token to the Authorization header with the appropriate format (e.g., `Bearer <access_token>` for OAuth 2.0). [Source 6](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/07/15/understanding-api-authorization-options-in-postman/)

5. **Write tests**: You can write tests for your authorized API requests using the JavaScript language in Postman. This allows you to verify the response, status code, and other aspects of your API requests. [Source 2](https://medium.com/aubergine-solutions/api-testing-using-postman-323670c89f6d)

Here's an example of how to set up OAuth 2.0 authorization in Postman:

1. Select "OAuth 2.0" from the Type dropdown in the Authorization tab.
2. Fill in the required details, such as grant type, client ID, client secret, and callback URL.
3. Click on the "Get New Access Token" button, provide the required details, and click on the "Request Token" button.
4. Authorize the request and receive the access token.
5. Click on "Use Token" and select "Postman Token" from the dropdown.
6. Send the API request and verify the response. [Source 8](https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com/testing-oauth2-authorization-in-postman/)

Remember that the specific steps and configurations might vary depending on the API you're working with. Always refer to the API documentation for detailed instructions on how to set up authorization and authentication. 

### How do you handle error responses in Postman and what steps do you take to troubleshoot issues?

Handling error responses in Postman and troubleshooting issues involves several steps. Here are some of the ways to handle error responses and troubleshoot issues in Postman:

1. **Using Postman Console**: When you encounter an exception, you can view the error details in the Postman Console. To access the console, go to View > Postman Console. After sending the request, you can see the error details in the console. Click on the drop-down and select RAW to view the raw error response ([Source 3](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/4068)).

2. **Catching exception and reading response stream**: In some cases, you may need to catch exceptions and read the response stream of the exception. This can be done using the following code snippet ([Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46650944/catch-external-api-error-message-as-in-postman-body)):

```csharp
WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("http://...");
WebResponse response = null;
try
{
    response = request.GetResponse();
}
catch (WebException webEx)
{
    if (webEx.Response != null)
    {
        using (var errorResponse = (HttpWebResponse)webEx.Response)
        {
            using (var reader = new StreamReader(errorResponse.GetResponseStream()))
            {
                string error = reader.ReadToEnd();
                // TODO: use JSON.net to parse this string
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Understanding HTTP Status Codes**: Familiarize yourself with various HTTP status codes and their meanings to better understand error responses. For example, a 400 Bad Request error indicates that the server cannot process the request due to a malformed syntax. A 500 Internal Server Error indicates that an unexpected condition was encountered, and no more specific message is suitable ([Source 1](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas-classic/messaging-cloud/csmes/rest-api-http-status-codes-and-error-messages-reference.html)).

4. **Troubleshooting requests**: Follow the guidelines provided by Postman for troubleshooting API requests. Some common issues include environment variables, setting global variables, and using delays with Newman. Refer to [Source 11](https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com/how-to-fix-common-errors-in-postman/) for examples and solutions to common errors in Postman.

5. **Receiving responses**: Postman provides a user-friendly interface to view multiple pieces of information from all of the responses. You can use options like Copy Response to copy the complete response to the clipboard, which is useful for sharing the response with others ([Source 8](https://www.javatpoint.com/response-in-postman)).

Remember that error handling and troubleshooting may vary depending on the specific API and the programming language being used. Always refer to the API documentation and use the appropriate error handling techniques for your language. 

### How do you set environment variables in Postman and how do you use them in your requests?

To set environment variables in Postman and use them in your requests, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Create an Environment in Postman**

1. In Postman, go to the "Collections" tab and create a new collection.
2. Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the collection, and select "Edit".
3. In the "Edit Collection" modal, click on the "Manage Environments" button.
4. Enter the environment name, then add a variable name and value. For example, `URL` as the variable name and `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` as the value.
5. Close the "Manage Environments" modal. The new environment should now be visible in the "No Environment" dropdown [Source 2](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postman/postman_environment_variables.htm).

**Step 2: Use Environment Variables in Requests**

1. In the request editor, select the environment you created from the dropdown menu.
2. Replace the URL or any other parameter with the environment variable using double curly braces `{{<Environment variable name>}}`. For example, `{{URL}}` [Source 1](https://www.toolsqa.com/postman/environment-variables-in-postman/).
3. Click "Send" to execute the request using the environment variable.

**Step 3: Use Environment Variables in Request Body**

To use environment variables in the request body, include them in the JSON object as shown below:

```json
{
  "string": "{{name}}",
  "number": {{port}}
}
```

[Source 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50240735/postman-how-to-use-environment-variables-in-request-body)

**Step 4: Importing Postman Variables to Dotcom-Monitor**

If you're using Dotcom-Monitor for load testing, you can import the environment variables from Postman to Dotcom-Monitor by following these steps:

1. Export the list of variables from Postman to a JSON file.
2. In Dotcom-Monitor, go to the corresponding Postman Collection task edit page.
3. On the Task Configuration sidebar, click the actions menu button and select "Manage Context Parameters".
4. In the "Manage Context Parameters", click "Import" and provide the JSON file with the list of variables exported from Postman.
5. Click "Done" [Source 5](https://www.dotcom-monitor.com/wiki/knowledge-base/how-to-work-with-postman-environment-variables-in-dotcom-monitor/).

**Note**: Environment variables in Postman are only available for folders, collections, and workspaces. You need to save a request to use them [Source 8](https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/how-to-use-environment-variable-in-postman-ba7c0f49f22e). 

### How would you automate the execution of a Postman collection, and what tools or methods would you use to accomplish it?

To automate the execution of a Postman collection, you can use the Postman Collection Runner or external tools like Newman. I'll discuss both methods and provide examples.

### Postman Collection Runner

Postman Collection Runner is a built-in tool that allows you to execute your collection sequentially with a single click. To use the Collection Runner, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Runner" button at the top of the Postman page, next to the "Import" button.
2. The Collection Runner page should appear. Set up the following:
   - Collection: Select the collection you want to run.
   - Environment: Select the environment associated with the collection.
   - Data file: (Optional) If you want to use a data file (CSV or JSON) for input, select the file.
3. Click the "Run" button to start executing the collection.

You can view the test status and results per iteration in the "Run Results" page [Source 4](https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/automation-test-automate-workflow-postman-collection-runner).

### Newman

Newman is an external command-line tool that allows you to run Postman collections and manage environments. To use Newman, you need to install it first. Once installed, you can run the following command:

```
newman run <collection_name>.json -e <environment_name>
```

This command will execute the specified collection using the specified environment [Source 9](https://medium.com/@mior/automation-with-postman-collection-runner-630c04b8064f).

### Example: Selecting specific requests in a collection

You can also use the `postman.setNextRequest()` function to select specific requests in a collection. For example, you can create a script that executes a request and then sets the next request based on the response:

```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

var responseBody = JSON.parse(responseBody);

if (responseBody.length === 0 || responseBody[0].name === "reject" || responseBody[0].name === "acceptedToSubmit") {
    postman.setNextRequest('Step 7: Find change order types');
} else {
    postman.setEnvironmentVariable("action_name", responseBody[0].name);
}
```

This script checks if the response has a status code of 200, and if not, it sets the next request to "Step 7: Find change order types" [Source 4](https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/automation-test-automate-workflow-postman-collection-runner).

### Pros and Cons

**Postman Collection Runner:**

- Pros:
  - Built-in tool, no need for external installations.
  - Easy to set up and use.
  - Supports data files (CSV or JSON) for input.

- Cons:
  - Limited to Postman's built-in functionality.

**Newman:**

- Pros:
  - Command-line tool, providing more control and flexibility.
  - Can be used in continuous integration pipelines.

- Cons:
  - Requires installation and setup.

In summary, both Postman Collection Runner and Newman can be used to automate the execution of a Postman collection. The Collection Runner is a built-in tool that is easy to use, while Newman is a command-line tool that provides more control and flexibility. Choose the method that best fits your needs and workflow. 

### Write a script that generates a random email address and uses it in a Postman request to create a new user in your system.

To generate a random email address and use it in a Postman request to create a new user, you can follow these steps:

1. Generate a random email address using a pre-request script.

```javascript
const uuid = require('uuid');
let email = uuid() + '@domain.com';
pm.environment.set('email', email);
```

This script uses the `uuid` library to generate a unique email address with a random domain. You can also use other libraries like `moment` or `_.random` for generating random email addresses, as shown in [Source 7](https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/36809/how-to-randomly-generate-email-address-on-postman-request-using-pre-request-scri).

2. Set the generated email address as an environment variable in Postman.

```javascript
pm.environment.set('email', email);
```

3. Use the environment variable in the request body to create a new user with the generated email address.

```
{
    "email": "{{email}}",
    "firstName": "{{FirstName}}",
    "lastName": "{{LastName}}"
}
```

Here, `{{FirstName}}` and `{{LastName}}` are dynamic variables provided by Postman to generate random first and last names, as shown in [Source 2](https://mattruma.com/adventures-with-postman-dynamic-variables/).

4. Send the POST request with the generated email address and other user information.

```
POST https://your-api-url.com/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "email": "{{email}}",
    "firstName": "{{FirstName}}",
    "lastName": "{{LastName}}"
}
```

This approach uses a pre-request script to generate a random email address and sets it as an environment variable in Postman. The email address is then used in the request body to create a new user. This method provides a secure and efficient way to generate random email addresses for testing purposes. 

### Walk me through the steps you would take to test the login functionality of an API using Postman.

To test the login functionality of an API using Postman, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a new request in Postman**: Open Postman and click on the "+" button to create a new request tab. Select the HTTP method (usually POST) for the login API endpoint [Source 4](https://developers.mural.co/public/docs/testing-with-postman).

2. **Enter the API endpoint URL**: In the request URL field, enter the full URL of the login API endpoint provided by the API documentation [Source 2](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-test-login-rest-API-service-using-postman).

3. **Add headers**: If the API requires specific headers (e.g., content type or authorization), add them to the request. For example, you might need to include an "Authorization" header with a bearer token [Source 4](https://developers.mural.co/public/docs/testing-with-postman).

4. **Add request body**: If the login API requires a request body (e.g., username and password), switch to the "Body" tab in Postman and select the appropriate format (e.g., x-www-form-urlencoded or JSON). Fill in the required fields with the appropriate values [Source 7](https://www.dataworks.ie/api-testing-with-postman-everything-you-need-to-know/).

5. **Send the request**: Click the "Send" button to send the login request to the API. Postman will display the response, including the status code and any returned data [Source 6](https://www.guru99.com/postman-tutorial.html).

6. **Verify the response**: Check the status code and any returned data to ensure that the login functionality is working as expected. If the API returns an error, you might need to adjust your request or consult the API documentation for more information [Source 6](https://www.guru99.com/postman-tutorial.html).

7. **Create tests**: To further verify the login functionality, you can create tests in Postman using the "Tests" tab. For example, you can check if the response status code is 200 and if specific data is present in the response body [Source 5](https://www.guru99.com/postman-tutorial.html).

```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response body contains specific data", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.someKey).to.eql("someValue");
});
```

8. **Run tests**: Click the "Send" button again to run the tests in Postman. The test results will be displayed, indicating whether the tests passed or failed [Source 5](https://www.guru99.com/postman-tutorial.html).

By following these steps, you can effectively test the login functionality of an API using Postman. Remember to consult the API documentation for specific details on the login API and any required parameters or headers. 

### How do you handle authentication tokens in Postman, and what methods do you use to verify that a user is logged in?

To handle authentication tokens in Postman, you can use pre-request scripts to fetch and attach bearer tokens to make testing your REST APIs easier. This can be done for different environments by storing a set of variables and switching the context of your requests [Source 1](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/set-up-postman-and-automatically-add-bearer-tokens).

To get an access token in Postman, you can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Postman Authorization tab of your request.
2. From the Type dropdown menu, select OAuth 2.0.
3. Click on the Get New Access Token button that will open a dialog box for configuring the identity server (e.g., Keycloak). Fill in the appropriate fields with the corresponding values for your environment [Source 6](https://sis-cc.gitlab.io/dotstatsuite-documentation/configurations/authentication/token-in-postman/).

After obtaining the access token, you can use it to authenticate and make requests on protected APIs. For example, you can add the token as an Authorization header in the request:

```
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

To verify that a user is logged in, you can check the response of the protected API for a specific status code (e.g., 200 OK) or a specific response header (e.g., `X-Auth-Token` or `X-User-Id`) that indicates the user is authenticated [Source 9](https://dev.trackunit.com/docs/verify-access-using-postman).

In case the access token expires, you can use a refresh token to obtain a new access token. Here's an example refresh request:

```
POST https://secure.na1.adobesign.com:443/oauth/v2/refresh
    "Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    Request body should contain the following parameters:
    "grant_type": refresh_token
    "client_id": <<Adobe Sign Application ID, step (05)>>
    "client_secret": <<Adobe Sign Application Secret, step (05)>>
    "refresh_token": <<Take refresh token from Postman, 'Manage Access Tokens' dialog.
```

The response should include a new access token and its expiration time [Source 8](https://helpx.adobe.com/sign/kb/how-to-create-access-token-using-postman-adobe-sign.html).

In summary, handling authentication tokens in Postman involves obtaining an access token, using it to authenticate requests, and refreshing the token when necessary. 

### Given a login endpoint that returns a JWT token, write a script that extracts the token from the response and uses it to authenticate subsequent requests.

To extract the JWT token from the response and use it for subsequent requests, you can follow the steps below:

1. Send a login request to the authentication server, providing the necessary credentials (username and password). The server should return a JWT token upon successful authentication.

```javascript
async function handleSubmit() {
  // Send the login request
  const response = await fetch('/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
  });

  // Extract the JWT token from the response
  const { jwt_token } = await response.json();

  // Use the JWT token for subsequent requests
}
```
[Source 4](https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/)

2. Store the JWT token securely, avoiding local storage as it is prone to XSS attacks. You can use an HttpOnly cookie, or store it in memory or a secure storage like IndexedDB.

```javascript
import { login } from '../utils/auth';
await login({ jwt_token });
```
[Source 4](https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/)

3. Attach the JWT token to the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests, using the `Bearer` schema.

```javascript
const jwt_token = getJwtToken(); // Implement a function to retrieve the JWT token from storage
const response = await fetch('/api/protected', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwt_token}`,
  },
});
```
[Source 3](https://jwt.io/introduction)

4. On the server-side, implement a middleware or authentication check to verify the JWT token. If the token is valid, the request will be allowed to access protected resources.

```php
public function render($request, Exception $e)
{
  if ($e instanceof \Tymon\JWTAuth\Exceptions\TokenInvalidException)
  {
    return response(['Token is invalid'], 401);
  }
  if ($e instanceof \Tymon\JWTAuth\Exceptions\TokenExpiredException)
  {
    return response(['Token has expired'], 401);
  }
  return parent::render($request, $e);
}
```
[Source 6](https://www.toptal.com/web/cookie-free-authentication-with-json-web-tokens-an-example-in-laravel-and-angularjs)

5. Optionally, implement a silent refresh mechanism to automatically refresh the JWT token when it expires. This can be done using a package like `apollo-link-token-refresh`.

```javascript
import { TokenRefreshLink } from 'apollo-link-token-refresh';
import { JwtPayload } from 'jwt-decode';
import { getJwtToken, getRefreshToken, setJwtToken } from './auth';
import decodeJWT from 'jwt-decode';

export function makeTokenRefreshLink() {
  return new TokenRefreshLink({
    isTokenValidOrUndefined: () => {
      const token = getJwtToken();
      if (!token) return true;
      const claims: JwtPayload = decodeJWT(token);
      const expirationTimeInSeconds = claims.exp * 1000;
      const now = new Date();
      const isValid = expirationTimeInSeconds >= now.getTime();
      return isValid;
    },
    fetchAccessToken: async () => {
      // Implement the logic to fetch a new access token
    },
    handleFetch: (accessToken) => {
      setJwtToken(accessToken);
    },
    handleResponse: (operation, accessTokenField) => (response) => {
      return { access_token: response.refreshToken.jwt };
    },
    handleError: (err) => {
      console.warn('Your refresh token is invalid. Try to reauthenticate.');
      localStorage.removeItem('jwt');
      localStorage.removeItem('refreshToken');
    },
  });
}
```
[Source 4](https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/)

By following these steps, you can extract the JWT token from the login response and use it for subsequent requests, while ensuring secure storage and verification on the server-side. 

### How would you test the functionality of generating and validating JWT tokens for guest users in Postman, and what methods or tools would you use to simulate a guest user scenario?

To test the functionality of generating and validating JWT tokens for guest users in Postman, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a guest user registration endpoint**: Implement an endpoint that allows creating a guest user with minimal information, such as an email address. In the response, include the JWT token for the guest user. Here's an example of how to create a guest user and generate a JWT token in Node.js using the `jsonwebtoken` library [Source 8]:

```javascript
app.post("/register-guest", async (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.body;
  // Validate user input and save the guest user to the database
  // ...

  // Create token
  const token = jwt.sign(
    { email },
    process.env.TOKEN_KEY,
    { expiresIn: "1h" }
  );

  res.status(200).json({ token });
});
```

2. **Send a request to the guest user registration endpoint in Postman**: Send a POST request to the `/register-guest` endpoint with the email address of the guest user. In the response, extract the JWT token [Source 9].

3. **Test the JWT token in protected endpoints**: To test the guest user's JWT token in protected endpoints, you can use the "Bearer" token type in the "Authorization" header of your requests in Postman. The format should be `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` [Source 2].

4. **Simulate a guest user scenario**: To simulate a guest user scenario, you can use Postman's built-in tools or scripts. One way to do this is to use Pre-request Scripts in Postman. Pre-request scripts are snippets of code that are executed before the request is sent, and they can be used to refresh the JWT token before sending the request [Source 5]. Here's an example of how to use a pre-request script to refresh the JWT token:

```javascript
pm.environment.set("token", "Bearer " + pm.response.json().token);
pm.sendRequest("https://your-api-url/protected-endpoint", (error, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log(response);
  }
});
```

This script sets the JWT token in the environment variable `token` and sends a request to the protected endpoint. The `pm.sendRequest` function sends the request, and the JWT token is automatically included in the "Authorization" header [Source 5].

By following these steps, you can test the functionality of generating and validating JWT tokens for guest users in Postman and simulate a guest user scenario. 

## CHALLENGE SCENARIO

### You have been tasked with testing the E2E functionality of a mobile app for a restaurant, which includes the ability for logged-in users to view and place orders from the restaurant's menu. Your task is to write a collection of Postman requests that test the following user flows:

Login: Write a request that authenticates a user with a valid username and password and returns an access token for the user session. Verify that the token is valid and can be used in subsequent requests.

Get Menu Items: Write a request that retrieves the list of menu items available for the restaurant. Verify that the response includes all necessary information for each item, such as name, description, price, and availability.

Add Item to Cart: Write a request that adds a selected menu item to the user's cart, including any special instructions or customizations. Verify that the item is added correctly and that the user's cart is updated with the correct total.

View Cart: Write a request that retrieves the user's current cart, including all items and their quantities, as well as the current subtotal, tax, and total. Verify that the cart contents and pricing are correct.

Place Order: Write a request that submits the user's cart as an order for the restaurant. Verify that the order is placed correctly and that the user receives a confirmation of the order, including an estimated delivery or pickup time.

To test the E2E functionality of the mobile app, you can create a collection of Postman requests that cover each user flow. Below are examples of how to create the requests for each flow:

1. **Login**

Create a POST request to the authentication endpoint with the valid username and password:

```
POST https://example.com/api/auth/login
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}

Body:
{
  "username": "valid_username",
  "password": "valid_password"
}
```

Verify the response contains the access token and the status code is 200 (OK).

2. **Get Menu Items**

Create a GET request to the menu items endpoint:

```
GET https://example.com/api/menu
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
```

Verify the response includes all necessary information for each menu item, such as name, description, price, and availability.

3. **Add Item to Cart**

Create a POST request to the add to cart endpoint with the selected menu item and any special instructions or customizations:

```
POST https://example.com/api/cart/add
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}

Body:
{
  "itemId": "menu_item_id",
  "quantity": 1,
  "customizations": {
    "instructions": "Add extra cheese"
  }
}
```

Verify the response contains the updated cart and the status code is 200 (OK).

4. **View Cart**

Create a GET request to the view cart endpoint:

```
GET https://example.com/api/cart
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
```

Verify the response includes all items, their quantities, the current subtotal, tax, and total.

5. **Place Order**

Create a POST request to the place order endpoint with the user's cart:

```
POST https://example.com/api/orders
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}

Body:
{
  "cartId": "cart_id"
}
```

Verify the response contains the placed order information, the estimated delivery or pickup time, and the status code is 200 (OK).

To execute these requests and verify the responses, you can use Postman's Collection Runner feature, which allows you to automate the testing process and save time and resources [Source 2](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/how-use-postman-manage-and-execute-your-apis). 

## ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES

### Test negative scenarios, such as attempting to place an order without being logged in or adding an item to the cart that is out of stock.

Use Postman's collection runner to run the E2E tests against a test environment or staging server, and generate a report of the results.

Add performance tests to the collection, such as testing the response time of each request and the overall end-to-end response time for a full order.

Incorporate automated validations into the collection, such as checking the format of the response data, verifying that the expected data is present, and checking for common errors or exceptions.

Write scripts that generate randomized user data, such as selecting random menu items or adding random customizations to items, to simulate more realistic testing scenarios.


To test negative scenarios and incorporate additional requirements, follow these steps:

1. **Negative Scenario - Place Order without being logged in**

Create a POST request to the place order endpoint without providing an access token:

```
POST https://example.com/api/orders
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "cartId": "cart_id"
}
```

Verify the response contains an error message indicating that the user is not logged in and the status code is 401 (Unauthorized).

2. **Negative Scenario - Add out of stock item to Cart**

Create a POST request to the add to cart endpoint with an out of stock item:

```
POST https://example.com/api/cart/add
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}

Body:
{
  "itemId": "out_of_stock_item_id",
  "quantity": 1,
  "customizations": {
    "instructions": "Add extra cheese"
  }
}
```

Verify the response contains an error message indicating that the item is out of stock and the status code is 400 (Bad Request).

To run E2E tests against a test environment or staging server and generate a report, use Postman's Collection Runner or Newman [Source 1](https://www.postman.com/automated-testing/).

To add performance tests, create custom scripts for each request that measure the response time and overall end-to-end response time for a full order. Use the `pm.response.timing()` function in the Pre-request Script tab of each request to collect timing data. After running the collection, analyze the results in the Collection Runner's Results page.

To incorporate automated validations, use the Test tab in each request to add test scripts. Include checks for the format of the response data, presence of expected data, and common errors or exceptions. You can use JavaScript to write test scripts and use the `pm.test` function to write test cases.

To generate randomized user data, create a script that exports the data to a JSON file. Import the data file into Postman using the Import button. Use the `pm.environment.get()` function to read the imported data in your Pre-request Script or Test script.

Here's an example of how to read the imported data and use it in a request:

```javascript
let randomItemId = pm.environment.get("item_id");
let randomQuantity = pm.environment.get("quantity");

pm.variables.set("itemId", randomItemId);
pm.variables.set("quantity", randomQuantity);
```

Then, use `{{itemId}}` and `{{quantity}}` in your request body to replace the placeholders with the actual values.

By following these steps, you can test negative scenarios, generate performance reports, incorporate automated validations, and use randomized user data to simulate more realistic testing scenarios.
